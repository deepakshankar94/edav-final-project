    ON CAMPUS PROJECTS


    AEP/TEP Study

    Research questions

    How successful are AEPs/TEPs in integrating learners into formal education or

            vocational education?

    To what extent are AEPs/TEPs successful in reaching and supporting

            marginalized learners? 

    The answers to these questions will help us to better understand:

    •   The extent to which AEPs/TEPs can foster resilience in children at scale and;

    •    What additional supports are required to serve marginalized children?

    Study design

    The study team is undertaking a mixed-methods study in support of the education efforts implemented by the Norwegian Refugee Council in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. Data collection will be longitudinal to allow for greater understanding of the learner experience and the long-term impact of attending two education programs (the AEP and the TEP). The study is focused on learners, ages 10-13, who are enrolled in the 1-year TEP, as well as learners, ages 10-17 enrolled in the 3-year AEP. The study design includes data collection upon enrollment in 2018, before graduation in 2019, immediately after graduation in 2019, and one year after enrollment in formal school in 2020. 2018 baseline data has been collected and will need to be cleaned and analyzed during the Fall semester.

    Time: 5hrs/week

    Deadline: Completed by late December

    Skillset: Data cleaning, Excel, Statistical analysis, Imputation

    Language: Not required but if available, French

    Learning opportunities: This will be an exciting opportunity to work on a global education program focused on the educational needs of refugees in the DR Congo and in Tanzania. Current work needs are for baseline analysis in 2018 but the project is four years in duration (a student interested in long term commitment will also be considered).

    The presentation will describe career opportunities at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), a non-profit think tank supporting the Department of Defense and other federal government agencies with multi-disciplinary research. IDA’s core staff includes nearly a thousand analysts, most of whom have PhDs in STEM fields, along with a large group of social scientists. Our work covers the spectrum of national security topics, from basic science and system evaluations to cost analyses, policy, force structure, training, human-machine interfaces, cybersecurity, intelligence, and strategic planning. Given the vital importance that applied statistics plays in our work, IDA created a dedicated Test Science group of about a dozen researchers, most with PhDs in statistics, to help increase the level of rigor in our test designs, data analyses, and uncertainty quantification. 

     

    Full-time positions as Research Staff Members and Research Associates are available to qualified candidates with Doctoral and Masters degrees. IDA also runs a Summer Associate program for graduate students and rising senior undergraduates and a two-year Science Policy Fellowship for recent Bachelor’s and Master’s degree recipients. Please note that all applicants must be able to obtain a security clearance, which requires US citizenship.
