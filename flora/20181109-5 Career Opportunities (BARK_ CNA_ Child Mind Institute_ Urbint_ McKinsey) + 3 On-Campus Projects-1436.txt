Brief Description
	

CNA's Data Science Team brings data science expertise and support to the Department of the Navy. The team develops advanced analytics and algorithms, including machine learning and predictive analytics, that could have a transformative impact on the Navy’s competitiveness. Research Scientists have some relevant research experience and an increasing ability to operate independently. They typically lead smaller and/or less complex projects, playing a critical role as a team member on projects with specific technical/scientific expertise, or operating as a field rep. Scientists are expected to consistently produce high quality analysis. Research Scientists in the Data Science Team work on projects to help the Department of the Navy and other government agencies develop advanced analytics and algorithms for systems, sensors, networks, and platforms to ensure America’s defense in the 21st century. Scientists will learn CNA's unique approach to analytics that combines an understanding of the technical capabilities with insights gained from up close and current experience with real-world military operations.

BARK is what happens when a bunch of crazy dog people turn an obsession into a profession. Our office is filled with dogs barking and burping, wrassling and chirping. (And laughter. Lots of laughter!) We’re looking for hard-working, dog-loving folks to join our pack and help us create wonderful new ways to make dogs happy.

As the first Data Scientist at BARK, you will be the point person supporting BARK’s growth, marketing, finance, and operations/planning/logistics teams by applying advanced analytical techniques to our rich and varied datasets, including but not limited to: subscriptions, orders, surveys, payments, email, shipments, web traffic, and external sources. In this hands-on strategic role, you will work with leadership across the organization to understand and develop methodologies for optimizing key performance metrics such as retention, campaign and funnel conversion, new subscribers, customer lifetime value, and more.

We are seeking a Senior ML Engineer to solve some of our hardest technical challenges. You will work closely with our clients, fellow engineers, deployment strategists and others across the company to implement projects from start to finish, participating in data discovery, analysis, algorithm development, feature extraction, and delivery of results.

You will have a real passion for using dirty, disparate data to optimize business processes and highlight relevant metrics and insightful stories. You prefer asking the right question as opposed to offering the right answer. You appreciate ambiguity and are comfortable guiding others while obsessing over details.

ON-CAMPUS PROJECTS
Survey of Women in America - Validation
Brief description: We want to survey roughly 1000 of the general population of women in America using Amazon mTurk and need help validating the survey, as well as analyzing the data when the survey results are in.
Anticipated workload and duration of this project: 3-5 hours/week x 2 weeks initially, then possibly 10 hours/week x1 week for data analysis
Desired outcome from Data Science Institute talent: Help with survey validation and data analysis
Desired technical/nontechnical skills? Data analysis with STATA or SPSS or R
To apply: Please contact Tiffany Sia at tys2105@cumc.columbia.edu if interested.
Paid?  No 

CardioThoracic Intensive Care Unit Study
Brief description: The CardioThoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU)-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) medical director on a Quality Improvement purpose, started to audit and feedback several indicators of good practice within an ICU few years ago, in order to observe the consequences on the habits of prescription and care of the clinicians.
We have monthly data about these indicators (numbers of transfusions, percentage of transfusions over the recommended threshold, ventilation duration for specific populations, number of Chest X-rays ordered, number of catheter related infections), for 2 to 3 years.
We started working on these data separately. We analyzed the consequences of the feedback on the trend of these indicators.
We now want to work on them globally, analyzing the link which could exist between all these data, within the same unit.
We have the data for the units we are in charged of but also the data of other intensive care units , and where no feedback were performed.
Desired outcome from Data Science Institute talent: We would like to extract a link between the trends we observe for these indicators, which are distinct but clearly represent the same habits of prescription and patient care among a team.
Desired technical/nontechnical skills? Statistical skill, Cooperative skill
